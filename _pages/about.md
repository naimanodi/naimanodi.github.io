I'm a  Master's student at Universität Trier, Germany, and I am currently looking for internships/werkstudent in the field of Natural Language Processing, preferably in the area of Generative AI. 

I am also interested for any research collaborations in academics. 📊

### HiWi at Universität Trier - (May 2025 - Continuing)
My current role as a Studentische Hilfskraft in the xPrEs: Crossmodal Perception Trace Embedding project, includes the analysis of multimodal data recorded via iMotions. 🥽 Where I am working on a novel content representation paradigm for multimedia documents by modeling sequences of attention shifts across multiple modalities, investigating and analyzing similarities and differences between human perceptual patterns and those learned by state-of-the-art representation learning techniques. 📊 

### Computational Linguistics Fall School - Sept 2024
Recently I had the incredible opportunity to be part of the Computational Linguistics Fall School 2024 at Universität Passau 🍂, sponsored by DGfS-CL and GSCL. It was a fantastic experience learning from distinguished instructors like [Jakob Prange](https://jakpra.github.io/) - Python for Linguistics, [Carina Silberer](https://sites.google.com/view/carinasilberer/home) - Multimodal CL and NLP, [John Lawrence](https://discovery.dundee.ac.uk/en/persons/john-lawrence) - Argument Mining, and [Raphael Buchmüller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphael-buchm%C3%BCller-b5699b183/) - Visual Analztics for Linguistics. The event brought together passionate students from around the world, creating a vibrant and collaborative atmosphere and sharing research insights.
