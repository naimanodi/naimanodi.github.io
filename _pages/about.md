I am a final year Master's student at Universit√§t Trier, Germany, and I am currently looking for internships in the field of Natural Language Processing, preferably in the area of Generative AI. 

My research interest are in Large language Model. 

I am also interested for any research collaborations in academics.

### Computational Linguistics Fall School 2024
Recently I had the incredible opportunity to be part of the Computational Linguistics Fall School 2024 at Universit√§t Passau, sponsored by DGfS-CL and GSCL. It was a fantastic experience learning from distinguished instructors like [Jakob Prange](https://jakpra.github.io/), [Carina Silberer](https://sites.google.com/view/carinasilberer/home) - Multimodal CL and Vision, [John Lawrence](https://discovery.dundee.ac.uk/en/persons/john-lawrence) - Argument Mining, and [Raphael Buchm√ºller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphael-buchm%C3%BCller-b5699b183/) - Visual Analztics for Linguistics. The event brought together passionate students from around the world, creating a vibrant and collaborative atmosphere and sharing research insights.
