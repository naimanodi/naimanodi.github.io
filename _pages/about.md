I'm a  Master's student at Universität Trier, Germany, and I am currently looking for internships/werkstudent in the field of Natural Language Processing, preferably in the area of Semantic analysis and Generative AI. 

I am also interested for any research collaborations in academics. 📊

### HiWi at Universität Trier - (Oct 2025 - Continuing)
My current role as a Studentische Hilfskraft at the Trier Center for Digital Humanities (TCDH) under the DFG funded project (Modernity as Loss?) involves Exploring narratives of decline and cultural critique in European literature (German). The task also comprises, investigating on the quantitative and qualitative approach to large literary corpora, supporting computational modeling of semantic and evaluative features using word embedding.

### HiWi at Universität Trier - (May 2025 - Sept 2025)
My role as a Studentische Hilfskraft in the xPrEs: Crossmodal Perception Trace Embedding project, included the analysis of multimodal data recorded via iMotions. 🥽 Where I have worked on a novel content representation paradigm for multimedia documents by modeling sequences of attention shifts across multiple modalities, investigating and analyzing similarities and differences between human perceptual patterns and those learned by state-of-the-art representation learning techniques. 📊 

### Computational Linguistics Fall School - Sept 2024
Recently I had the incredible opportunity to be part of the Computational Linguistics Fall School 2024 at Universität Passau 🍂, sponsored by DGfS-CL and GSCL. It was a fantastic experience learning from distinguished instructors like [Jakob Prange](https://jakpra.github.io/) - Python for Linguistics, [Carina Silberer](https://sites.google.com/view/carinasilberer/home) - Multimodal CL and NLP, [John Lawrence](https://discovery.dundee.ac.uk/en/persons/john-lawrence) - Argument Mining, and [Raphael Buchmüller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphael-buchm%C3%BCller-b5699b183/) - Visual Analztics for Linguistics. The event brought together passionate students from around the world, creating a vibrant and collaborative atmosphere and sharing research insights.

### HiWi at Universität Trier - (Aug 2024 - Jan 2025)

Studentische Hilfskraft - Anglistik Department, University of Trier

I have worked as a Student Assistant in the Anglistik Department at the University of Trier, focusing on the field of Speaker Diarization and machine speaker identification. 🎙️
Contributed to the Mismatch Condition in Machine Speaker Identification project, where I explore ways to improve recognition accuracy in challenging acoustic conditions. 👭
Explored machine learning models, integrating feature extraction and noise robustness techniques to enhance speaker recognition performance across diverse acoustic environments. 🔍
The work is under review in the "Problems of Forensic Sciences" Journal under the title "Challenges for Auditory and Automatic Speaker Identification: Evaluating Cases of Highly Similar Voices"
